Guess the Number Game

This is a simple "Guess the Number" game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Game Description

The player is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The JavaScript code generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then compares the player's guess with the random number. The player is given feedback on whether their guess is too low or too high, and the number of attempts is displayed. If the player guesses the correct number, a congratulatory message is displayed and the input and button are disabled.
